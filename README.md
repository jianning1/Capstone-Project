# Capstone-Project
This project aims to explore the application of long short-term memory (a type of recurrent neural networks) in text classification and sentiment analysis.

#
Raw dataset is consisted of 8000 news articles from 1951 to 2014, each article was judged on the relativeness with US economy, and if relevant, its sentiment was evaluated on a 9 point scale, higher score represents higher positivity while 1 point stands most negative.

#
Full_version.ipynb: include data pre-processing, EDA, text classification and sentiment analysis.

Pre_processing_+_EDA.ipynb: include data pre-processing and EDA.

Bi_LSTM_classification.ipynb: include text classification and sentiment analysis.
